## Task 1. Working with the cat utility

You need to develop a cat utility:
- Support of all flags (including GNU versions) specified [above](#cat-options)

## Task 2. Working with grep utility

You need to develop the grep utility:
- Support of the following flags: `-e`, `-i`, `-v`, `-c`, `-l`, `-n`
- Only pcre or regex libraries can be used for regular expressions  


## Task 3. Implementation of some grep utility flags

You need to develop the grep utility:
- Support of all flags, including: `-h`, `-s`, `-f`, `-o`

## Task 4. Implementation of grep utility flag combinations

You need to develop the grep utility:
- Support of all flags, including their _pair_ combinations (e.g. `-iv`, `-in`)
